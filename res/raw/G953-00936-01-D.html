Google Consumer Hardware Limited Warranty – Australia and New Zealand
<br/><br/>

If there are any differences between this Limited Warranty included in the box with your product and the online Limited Warranty available at g.co/devicewarranty, then, to the extent permitted by law, the online Limited Warranty will supersede the terms of this in-the-box warranty.
<br/><br/>

This warranty applies if you are a consumer and purchased your Google-branded product (referred to as a 'Google Product') in Australia or New Zealand.
<br/><br/>

<b>Limited Warranty</b>
<br/><br/>

If you purchased your Google Product in Australia, the following applies to your Google Product:
<br/><br/>

Your Google Product comes with guarantees that cannot be excluded under the Australian Consumer Law. You are entitled to a replacement or refund for a major failure and compensation for any other reasonably foreseeable loss or damage. You are also entitled to have the Google Product repaired or replaced if the Google Product fails to be of acceptable quality and the failure does not amount to a major failure. In addition to all applicable guarantees, Google offers this Limited Warranty.
<br/><br/>

If you purchased your Google Product in New Zealand, the following applies to your Google Product:
<br/><br/>

If you are entitled to the benefit of the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 (CGA), our goods come with guarantees that cannot be excluded under the New Zealand Consumer Law. Where these guarantees operate and the problem with your Google Product cannot be fixed or is of 'substantial character' within the meaning of the CGA, then you are entitled to a replacement or refund or compensation for any drop in the value of the Google Product. In addition to these remedies, you may claim for any reasonably foreseeable loss (other than loss or damage through reduction of value of the Google Product) that results from the initial problem. If the problem with your Google Product can be fixed, then you may either be entitled to have your Google Product repaired or replaced or, in certain circumstances, the purchase price of your Google Product refunded. In addition to any applicable guarantees, Google offers this Limited Warranty.
<br/><br/>

The following applies to Google Products purchased in Australia or New Zealand:
<br/><br/>

Google warrants that the Google Product will be free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use as described in the user guide for two years from the date of original purchase by you anywhere in Australia or New Zealand. If a Google Product has been refurbished by Google or a third party authorised by Google ('Refurbished'), Google warrants that the Refurbished Google Product (including any ancillary parts that may be packaged with it) will be free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use in accordance with Google's published user documentation for ninety days from the original date of retail purchase by you. These warranties are collectively referred to as Google’s 'Limited Warranty'.
<br/><br/>

This Limited Warranty is only valid and enforceable in Australia and New Zealand and will apply only if you have purchased your Google Product from Google or its authorised resellers. This Limited Warranty only applies to hardware components (and not to any software elements) of the Google Product. This Limited Warranty also does not apply to any consumable parts, such as batteries or protective coatings, that due to their nature diminish over time, unless failure has occurred due to a defect in materials or workmanship, nor to any cosmetic damage unless failure has occurred due to a defect in materials or workmanship. This Limited Warranty does not apply to damage caused by: (1) normal wear and tear; (2) accidents; (3) misuse (including failure to follow product documentation); (4) neglect; (5) disassembly; (6) alterations; (7) servicing other than by Google-authorised technicians; and (8) external causes such as, but not limited to: liquid damage, exposure to sharp objects, exposure to excessive force, anomalies in the electrical current supplied to the Google product, or extreme thermal or environmental conditions. Liquid damage voids this Limited Warranty. This Limited Warranty does not guarantee that use of the Google Product will be uninterrupted or error-free.
<br/><br/>

The ninety-day Limited Warranty Google provides for Refurbished Google Products is not applicable to Google Products refurbished by third-parties not authorised to do so by Google, even if sold by a Google authorised reseller.
<br/><br/>

If, in addition to a defect covered by this Limited Warranty, your Google Product also has damage which is not covered (for example, damage caused by normal wear and tear or misuse by you) then Google is only responsible for addressing the defect covered by this Limited Warranty.
<br/><br/>

If your Google Product has sustained liquid damage this Limited Warranty no longer applies and Google will not carry out any repair work. Google will give you the option of: (1) replacing your Google Product at your cost (and Google will tell you the amount in advance); or (2) Google returning your Google Product to you.
<br/><br/>

For the avoidance of doubt, and despite anything else contained in this Limited Warranty, to the extent that Google makes any express representation as to the water resistance of a Google Product, you may be entitled to certain remedies under applicable consumer law (including a refund or replacement for a major failure or failure of 'substantial character', as described above) if the Google Product does not operate in accordance with that representation.
<br/><br/>

<b>WARRANTY REMEDY FOR AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND</b>
<br/><br/>

If a defect arises and you return your Google Product as directed by  Google during the Limited Warranty period (which is two years for new Google Products and ninety days for Refurbished Google Products), Google will replace your Google Product with a new or refurbished Google Product functionally at least equivalent to yours. If applicable, a Google Product presented for repair may be replaced by a refurbished Google Product of the same type rather than being repaired, and refurbished parts may be used to repair Google Products. If Google replaces the Google Product, the replaced Google Product will continue to be warranted for the remaining time of the original warranty period. All returned parts for which you have received a replacement will become the property of Google. Replacement or repair of your Google Product may result in the loss of any user-generated data. Please ensure that you have made a copy of any data saved on your Google Product. Nothing in this Limited Warranty will reduce or otherwise affect your statutory rights in relation to the Google Product.

<br/><br/>

If you use this Limited Warranty, you will be responsible for the costs associated with returning the Google Product to Google, unless you have made alternative arrangements with Google. Google will be responsible for the costs associated with sending to you the new or refurbished Google Product.
